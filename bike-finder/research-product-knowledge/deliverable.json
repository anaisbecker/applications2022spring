It was helpful in learning about what the options are and discovering what I didn&rsquo;t know about bikes that I needed to research more heavily. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c6"><a class="c4" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bikeradar.com/features/beginners-guide-to-buying-a-bike/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1643066987521316&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Nw2tmGph8s6KN-VGNnmvP">https://www.bikeradar.com/features/beginners-guide-to-buying-a-bike/</a></span><span class="c5">&nbsp;(Beginner&rsquo;s Bike Guide)</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">On this website, I learned about all of the features of a bike that a cyclist might care about, and the different options/price points that a buyer can pick. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">What big questions will a buyer be faced with?/What priorities might a buyer have?</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">What price? What terrain will I be biking on? (road, dirt, etc.), Is this age appropriate? What level of activity? (sport vs. commute) What material is best based on these parameters? What size bike? What color? What kind of gears?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Types of Bikes</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Commuters prefer hybrids or tourers, people preferring more athletic/sport riding but still on the road would get road racing bikes or sportive bikes, off road would get mountain bikes, and people who are not cycling for fitness should look at electric bikes. There is also the consideration of age, as kids require a different type of bike, and smaller.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Gears</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">One thing I learned from Bike Radar is that the gears you choose are extremely important to riding the bike, so I chose to add some specific research on them. Most bikes are a wide range of gears so that you can ride on most terrain (such as hills). However, if you are riding mostly on flat roads, you don&rsquo;t need lower gears that mountain bikes would have. There are also options such as derailleurs and hub gears, each of which has pros and cons depending on your use of the bike. Finally, you can opt to have a singlespeed bike, which has only one gear (which is good for flat urban transportation or experienced mountain bikers). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Size</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">Finally, I chose to focus on sizing, as this is one of the most crucial aspects of buying a bike. Bike sizes correspond to leg length. You want to be able to stand over the bike and still have a little space in between your body and the bike, and when sitting, you want to be able to have your knee raised almost 90 degrees on the pedal. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Buying a Bike</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5">I &ldquo;bought&rdquo; a bike from REI (the website I researched on). I noticed they first had a Cycle section on their initial drop down menu. Within this section, they had subsections of types of bikes, but also a section for bicycle components. Upon entering the Road Bikes section, there is a detailed filter column, with filters based on more specific types of bike, best use, size, number of gears, price, etc. I was able to compare a few bikes to weigh my options, but I found it a little unfriendly to the user, as the button to start the comparison was not obvious to me. On the actual page for the bike I chose, I was able to see specifications, as well as choose sizing (with the included size chart). I&rsquo;m also able to see reviews, FAQs, and see photos of the bike itself. One thing I would have really appreciated in this shopping experience was a way to determine what specifications I needed, as I don&rsquo;t know what types of gears, material, etc. I need for my usage of the bike. Especially upon reading about the importance of choosing bike gears and size, I would have hoped those would have more information/interactive capabilities. (I did think the filters based on usage were somewhat helpful, though).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
